# Investigate_a_dataset
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
I brainstormed some questions that I answered using the dataset I explored.

The results from the analysis, reports and conclusions can be accessed in the [html]()

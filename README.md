# Investigate_a_dataset
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
I brainstormed some questions that I answered using the dataset I explored. The data set for the analysis can be accessed through this [Link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042115000)

The results from the analysis, reports and conclusions can be accessed [Here](https://github.com/Elohorokpako/Investigate_a_dataset/blob/main/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)
